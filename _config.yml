  Iâ€™m a programmer who loves to write a neat & efficient code. I was mostly working with C++ for past game development and C# .NET for mobile & web application development, also other languages such as Java, Python, ActionScript, etc. depends on the projects. I am interested to improve my experience and programming skill on C++ or Java, and especially C# .NET. But still possible to learn other programming languages.

          I was working in a team which creates automation system for cell culture as backend Software Engineer. I was worked in some scopes such as infrastructure & scheduler to build a software uwing C# ASP .NET.
		  As infrastructure team, I implement unit test using xUnit to catch bugs early before deploy the code with real hardware.
		  As scheduler team, I implement error handling so the system can take a recovery action if there is an unexpected behavior.
