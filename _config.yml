  Iâ€™m a programmer who loves to write a neat & efficient code. I was mostly working with C++ for past game development and C# .NET for mobile & web application development, also other languages such as Java, Python, ActionScript, etc. depends on the projects. I am interested to improve my experience and programming skill on <mark>C++</mark> or <mark>Java</mark>, and especially <mark>C#</mark> .NET. But still possible to learn other programming languages.

          I was working in a team which creates automation system for cell culture as backend Software Engineer. I was worked in some scopes such as infrastructure & scheduler to build a software using C# <mark>ASP .NET</mark>.
          As infrastructure team, I implement **unit test** using <mark>xUnit</mark> to catch bugs early before deploy the code with real hardware.
          As scheduler team, I implement **error handling** so the system can take a recovery action if there is an unexpected behavior.

          This project gives me knowledges about online multiplayer & DLC sytem.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          * **Online multiplayer** code running in *Game Server*, to remove this feature I need to migrate some code which running in server side (using **Python**) to be running on client side (using **C++**).
          * Modify the *building system* in Python language to reduce the game size based on *Game Designer* requirement, including to modify the current mechanism to build **DLC** assets.

          I got new experiences to use Flash IDE (an old tool using *ActionScript*).

          This game is adapt from the old version, so I **update the libraries used to the new version** with minimum risk to break the game.
          * Updating the old libraries into new version leads to create so many issues. My task is to find the best version which not producing too many errors within a given time.
          * The game UI are reworked, *Game Designer* need programmer to **integrate UI with the game code** in *ActionScript*.
          * The game has no cloud storage implementation yet, here I help the team to **implement Cloud Save** using company's internal library.

          It's the most awesome project as C++ game programmer for me.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project is my favourite, because I am working on game **physics behavior**. We're changing the non-football game into a football game. Most of my tasks are **implement 3D collision & physics behavior** (gravity, force, etc.) of the game. Also got task related to ball's AI which relies a lot on physical and mathematical calculations.
          Another tasks:
          * In battle mode (human vs AI), there are two balls which can collide the goal net in different position at the same time and we're using animation to perform goal net's touched behavior. I'm successfully implement new behavior using **cloth-like body behavior**, to the goal net become more realistic when being hit by two balls.
          * In other mode, the user need to hit the bulls eye as **breakable object** and I'm implement this **with physics behavior** so the object scatterd in random direction based on collision point.
          * Also I'm implement the ball's trajectory which can be moving in **curved trajectory** using mathematical calculation.
